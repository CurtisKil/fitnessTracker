## Usage

The primary purpose of this application is so that the user can create and track daily workouts. They are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They are also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.

## Credits

This was a homework assignment created by Trilogy Education Services and they supplied the front end code. My tutor helped out a little on the backend.
